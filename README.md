# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Antoine, an avid programmer currently immersed in the exciting world of indie game development! ðŸŽ® I am also deeply passionate about AI and full stack development, and always eager to explore new technologies and push the boundaries of what's possible.

I love crafting experiences that can be shared with others- I'm currently working on a game called [Archesis](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2369930/Archesis/) under my indie game studio [Dynabox Games](https://www.dynaboxgames.com)!

On the AI front, I'm in the process of developing Examon AI, a platform that leverages generative AI and GPT technology to create IB exam-style questions, mark schemes, and model answers for students. It's also designed to mark and provide feedback on student uploaded answers. The free early-release version is available here: [examon.ai](https://examon.ai).

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools

I specialise in Unity and C# for game development and MERN stack for full stack development (using frameworks like nextjs or gatsby). However, I'm always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies when needed. You'll also find me working with TypeScript, Java, Swift, Python for AI and ML, AWS for cloud services and more!
